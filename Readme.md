# Triangulate.xyz

This is the source code for [Triangulate.xyz](https://www.triangulate.xyz) which allows you to create computer generated art.

I created this project to learn ReactJS, this was my first project. I also wanted to make a backend in Golang and learn how to integrate Stripe for payments.

To run the project simply type the following in the root folder:

`yarn --cwd=assets build && go run cmd/triangulate/main.go`

This project takes a lot of concepts and code from [generative-art-in-go](https://github.com/preslavrachev/generative-art-in-go) and [triangle](https://github.com/esimov/triangle).
